Peptide-Fragment-Bin-Allocator
==============================

Rapid algorithm for allowing the sorting of variable length peptide fragments into m/z bins. Allowing the switching between sliding and none-sliding bins. 

The description of the algorithm is commented throughout the Perl script. 

Some of the results are shown here with varying enzymes and accuracy, bin size and incoporating up to one missed cleavage:
